## Hello and welcome to my website!

# My Research #
I'm a third-year PhD Student at the University of Michigan, where I work with [Dallas Card](https://dallascard.github.io//) and [David Jurges](https://jurgens.people.si.umich.edu/). My primary interests surround how to build and apply Natural Language Processing systems to better understand media, politics, and interpersonal communication. My recent work explores some of these questions in [online news](https://aclanthology.org/2023.findings-emnlp.420/) and [Reddit](https://aclanthology.org/2023.sicon-1.7/). If you'd like to get in touch, you can email me at blitt\@umich.edu !

I'm currently pursuing a number of research questions such as: 

* How can NLP tools and data be applied to understand the podcast ecosystem?  
* How do we incorporate audio information for a richer representation of spoken language? 
* How do we appropriately model influence and status in interpersonal communication? 

In the future, I'm interested in studying broader research domains such as: 

* The application of causal inference techniques with text-data as features, particularly in applied, policy-relevant domains
* Techniques for identifying the temporal evolution of intellectual communities, particularly in digital media environments 

# Personal Background # 
Before starting my PhD, I completed my undergraduate degree at Iowa State University. During this time I worked with [Robert Jernigan](https://www.bbmb.iastate.edu/people/robert-jernigan) on problems in Computational Biology, with a focus on the identification of the function of proteins. I also spent time working with [Shawn Dorius](https://soc-cj.iastate.edu/profiles/shawn-dorius/) and [Cassandra Dorius](https://www.datascience.iastate.edu/people/cassandra-dorius) at the Public Science Collaborative studying substance-use and community health in Iowa. Finally, I spent time at Worcester Polytechnic Institute working on NLP applications for mental health, where I was advised by [ML Tlachac](https://www.bryant.edu/academics/faculty/tlachac-ml) and [Elke Rundensteiner](https://www.wpi.edu/people/faculty/rundenst).
